* Create a Syn -> IR pipeline to simplify Block / Stmt / Expr notation
  * Should ultimately work similar to parse_quote

  DONE: Implemented via elysian_expr, elysian_stmt, elysian_block macros

* Support the full range of expression functions

  DONE: All existing functions are covered

* Generalize and make less brittle
  * Introspecting the structure of PropertyIdentifier / Identifier
    and relying on implementation details of its ToTokens impl
    in order to sub in passthrough identifiers is not ideal

  * Need to be able to inject arbitrary literals from the outer rust context
    without specializing too hard around structure
    * Baseline is arbitrary types of identifiers, but general IR substitution would be ideal
      * i.e. Being able to bind an elysian_expr! result,
        and inject it directly into another elysian_*! invocation without needing to inline

  * Should be able to inject rust attributes to mark elements for replacement
    instead of checking against specifically-named idents
    * How to preserve these attributes across the Rust -> IR -> Rust boundary?
      * May need to integrate more tightly so it skips concrete IR
        and goes straight from Rust -> Rust
      * Some sort of ToTokens wrapper trait that can introduce metadata via param?

  DONE: Reimplemented using a Rust -> Rust parser that interpolates by default,
        and uses a # prefix to compose pre-converted IR

* Create equivalent macro for parsing a rust function into a FunctionDefinition
  * Will need to support FunctionIdentifier substitution

  DONE: Implemented as declarative elysian_function macro

==============================================================================================

* Create equivalent macro for parsing a rust struct into a StructDefinition
  * Will need to support StructIdentifier substitution

* Expansion functionality for unsupported Rust operations
  * ex. Converting add-assign into a write
        Converting do / while / for into loop w/conditional breaks
