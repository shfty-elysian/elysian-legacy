* Elysian -> Mesh pipeline
  * Automate Elysian -> Mesh process

* Elysian -> Shader pipeline
  * Automate Elysian -> naga IR -> WGSL -> Shader process

* Elysian -> Entity pipeline
  * Split an Elysian at selected boolean operations
    * Create corresponding entity hierarchy w/appropriate control components
    * Union can be emulated via depth buffer
    * Overlay can be emulated with explicit mesh Z-ordering
