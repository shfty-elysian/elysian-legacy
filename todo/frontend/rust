* Generate a module of shape functions that can be compiled into an application via build.rs
  
  DONE: IR can now be converted into a coherent rust module

============================================================================================

* Integrate syn
  * Need to represent via tree of syn types rather than TokenTree

* Integrate prettyplease
  * Useful for visualizing generated code, and as an output option

* Compatibility layer to bridge Interpreter and build.rs functionality
  * Need some sort of interface that unifies I / O
    * Params and return value in the case of functions
    * Initial context writes and final read in the case of Interpreter
  * Likely able to implement some trait on a known type in the generated module,
    use that to dispatch to the precompiled field function
